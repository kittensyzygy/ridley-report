The *Final Report of the Nationalised Industries Policy Group*, better known as the **Ridley Report** was a Conservative document, drawn up in 1977 while the Tories were in opposition, outlining a strategy for running and privatising nationalised industries - like mines, buses, shipbuilding and airports - when they were back in power.

When leaked, the confidential report drew particular controversy for the language with which it described the working-class formed in trade unions. The Tories saw the working-class as their "enemies", demonised them as "communist disruptors", and wanted to "provoke a battle" with them. The report outlined just how the Conservatives would wage war with the working-class, primarily by breaking the power of people organised in trade unions - a plan to which the Tories, under Margaret Thatcher, adhere during their successful campaign against the miners in 1984â€“85.
